**Lois Anne G. Logronio**

  * Project Name:**Joy For Kids Shopping Cart and Donation System**

  * Client Name:**Joy For Kids (JFK) Universal Foundation**

# Details #

**A. Tasks accomplished**

> I modified the use case diagram because it will be a reference for the test cases of the system. I started doing the test case donation module for the system. With the team, I managed to transfer our works from Yii basic template to Yii advanced template. I assigned new tasks to my members and integrated the works of my members.

**B. Problems encountered**

> I had a hard time on pulling and pushing my works on the repository. Also, I had a hard time on which work to be prioritize. I don't know how to make a test case.

**C. Possible solutions**

> I created a backup file of my work locally then delete my project folder to clone the new project from the repository. I listed all the works to be done then rank it. After that, I divided the tasks to my members so it will be much easier for the work to be finished. I looked at the test case sample docu in moodle for qulity for it to be my guide in making a test case.

**D. Next steps to accomplish**

> I will make Gantt Chart for the JFK test plan and start making requirements traceability matrix after creating all test cases. I will start creating CRUD for the shopping cart module.
