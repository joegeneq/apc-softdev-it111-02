# Meeting Minutes: #

**1. Topics Discussed:**

> The team discussed on how to run and edit the existing system of JFK foundation.

**2. Items Agreed Upon**

> The team agreed to know how to install Wordpress so that the team can run and edit the system.

**3. Items to be clarified**

> The important thing that has to be clarified right now is what project are we going to do since Mr. Boogie said that the business idea for TENTREP subject has to be implemented for the SOFTDEV subject. Another confusion is if the teachers are really going to connect the subjects, what groupings are we going to follow. Another problem is that the business ideas created for the TENTREP subject are not applicable for the SOFTDEV subject.

**4. Next Things to Do**

> The team will continue on learning Yii 2.0 and know how will the copy of the existing system of JFK foundation will run on each member's computer.

**5. Conclusion**

> For now, the team for SOFTDEV will continue to work on the proposed project and will set aside the confusion for the TENTREP subject.
