				<h3>About JFK Universal Foundation, Inc.</h3>
				<h3></h3>
					<p>
					Constantly inspired by the idea of giving back to underprivileged children, JFK Universal Foundation, Inc. constantly seeks the support of talented individuals and corporations worldwide to provide the best opportunities for Filipino children to live and lead joyful, better lives.
					</p>
					<br />

					Its goal is to make available all resources and access to their rights and privileges- especially those in remote tribal islands- and improve their basic standards of existence.
					</p>

					<p>
					It pursues to empower them to develop their awareness as “children”, as “Filipinos”, and thereby become self-reliant individuals.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
					JFK Universal is headquartered in Metro Manila and has maintained partnerships with charitable organizations involved with aiding children around the world.
