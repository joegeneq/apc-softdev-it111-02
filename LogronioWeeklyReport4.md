**Lois Anne G. Logronio**

  * Project Name:**Joy For Kids Shopping Cart and Donation System**

  * Client Name:**Joy For Kids (JFK) Universal Foundation**

# Details #

**A. Tasks accomplished**

> I fixed the page connection problem where the newly created pages cannot be seen. I inserted functions in the SiteController.php file so that pages can be seen. I added and modified the table for the donation then created CRUD for the donation module. I integrate the works accomplished by each member.

**B. Problems encountered**

> I had a hard time on finding a suitable extension for the donation and shopping cart module. Also, I don't have any idea on how to design shirts and other items with the jfk logo.

**C. Possible solutions**

> As a replacement for the extension, I use CRUD for the donation and shopping cart module. For the design of the products, I asked for somebody's help to assist me on how am I going to put the jfk logo in the products.

**D. Next steps to accomplish**

> I will update the Use Case where I have to remove the _unregistered users_ in the diagram. I will continue on programming the donation and shopping cart system. For the documentation, I will divide the new documentation to be done among the members of the group 2.
