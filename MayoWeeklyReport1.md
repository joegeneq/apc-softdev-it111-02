A. Tasks accomplished
since it is the 1st meeting, we have not decided which module will be done by who. But we were able to decide on the major modules of the system and the design as well. Talked about how to run or integrate a wordpress application in Yii.

B. Problems encountered
The major problem we encountered is that we can't run the application in Yii. When it comes to the design, since we have a lo of ideas, we took a little bit of time to decide on the final one.

C. Possible solutions
Communicate with the person who made the website and talked about the codes and system. Read on how to transfer from wordpress to yii.

D. Next steps to accomplish
the next steps will be to finally run the system and see that is already working so that we can continue on the system the client requires.
