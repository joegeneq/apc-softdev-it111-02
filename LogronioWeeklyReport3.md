**A. Tasks accomplished**

> I have started doing the user interface of the Joy For Kids Shopping Cart and Donation System. I accomplished doing the model and CRUD generator, search, and dropdown list for this week's exercise.

**B. Problems encountered**

> First, I am clueless on how am I going to do the user interface. Second, I thought I had created the model and CRUD for the exercise correctly but when we had our second exercise for this week, that's the time I discovered that it was wrong. Also, somehow I had a hard time on communicating on one of my members.

**C. Possible solutions**

> I have watched tutorials on Youtube and ask my classmates on how to modify the user interface of Yii 2.0. For the exercises, I repeat on doing the model and CRUD generator and so I figured out that the path that I had created was wrong. Regarding on the member that I have mentioned above, I managed to talk to that person.

**D. Next steps to accomplish**

> I will continue on modifying the user interface, study Yii 2.0 framework, and learn how to insert a slider on a webpage. Also, I will still report the things that will be discussed on the succeeding meetings.
